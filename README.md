# AI Excuse generator - Portfolio piece template

This was created off the back of the OpenAI API github [Open API Quickstart tutorial](https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-node). Well worth checking out if you haven't and has useful documentation for testing yourself.

This was just my version of piggy-backing off to create a portfolio piece 🫡

## Setup

1. If you don’t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node.js version >= 14.6.0 required)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-quickstart-node
   ```

4. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   On Linux systems: 
   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```powershell
   $ copy .env.example .env
   ```
6. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

7. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ npm run dev
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

## How to use this template

The whole point of this template is that you create your **OWN** version, you need something that shows personality and lets you flex your particular coding skills.

- Can you make something specific to the job role you're looking for?
- What are your personal interests?
- Is there a technology you're trying to get hired in, can you integrate it here?
